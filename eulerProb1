'''
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

userRange = int(input("Give me a number and I'll calculate the sum of it's multiples of three and five: "))
sum_ = 0
for i in range(userRange):
    if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0:
    #take i and add it to zero
        sum_ += i
        print(sum_)
